1) what is diff








=========================================== NOTED SECTION =====================================================================
checkout file_name ==> recover content of a given file that is modified last time
checkt out -f      ==> recover content of a all files that is modifed last time       ( simply it match current file with last file and recover it )
add   file_name    ==> add file to the stagged area that is git term
add   -A           ==> add alll files to the stagged that is git term 
log 
log -p -1   ( -1 mean any number that show how many file loges do you show from last ) 
diff               ==> diff compare working directory with stagging area
		       if both are the same i won't show anything, show difference 
		       otherwise
diff --staged     ==> compare working directory with last commit
git commit -a -m "String"  ==> it skip stagging area but it's recommended not to 
				use it frequently becasue git's stagging area
				superb.
rm  file_name 	  ==> remove file from the working directory and git stagging area
rm --cached filename ==> just remove from the stagging area
